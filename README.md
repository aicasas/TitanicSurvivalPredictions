# TitanicSurvivalPredictions
This project aims to predict who was most likely to survive the Titanic. 
A data frame with 2 columns: PassengerID, and the predicted Survival. 
The predictions were done using Logistic Regression 

Logistic Regression Conclusions:
The most important factors in determining who survived were: 
Sex (Females were most likely) 
Parchild, or SibSp: Whether or not the individual was traveling with others
Class: First class passengers were most likely to survive. 

Here are some scenarios and the likeliness of survival: 
Women of any age &amp; in first class were very likely to survive. 
Women under 40 years old had 100% survival rate. 
Older men were very likely not to survive. 
Men traveling in first class with a parent or child had a 50% chance of survival
